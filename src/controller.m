function [F, M] = controller(t, state, des_state, params)
%CONTROLLER  Controller for the quadrotor
%
%   state: The current state of the robot with the following fields:
%   state.pos = [x; y; z], state.vel = [x_dot; y_dot; z_dot],
%   state.rot = [phi; theta; psi], state.omega = [p; q; r]
%
%   des_state: The desired states are:
%   des_state.pos = [x; y; z], des_state.vel = [x_dot; y_dot; z_dot],
%   des_state.acc = [x_ddot; y_ddot; z_ddot], des_state.yaw,
%   des_state.yawdot
%
%   params: robot parameters

%   Using these current and desired states, you have to compute the desired
%   controls
